	--To move schema from 11g to another db need do manual operations.

	12c
	--In multitenant db's  share one instance.
	--Can support mult覺ple databases
	--It support 253 pdb.
	--They shared
	--You can backup single db
	
	
		THE CDB "SUPER DATABASE"
	
	--CDB is a database which contains sub databases.



					******CDB******
					
	-- CDB contains one or multiple PDB's.
	-- Root container is a collection of Oracle supplies objects metadata.
	-- PDB is a collection of schemas tables and objects.Which directly support an application.
	-- Applications connect directly to the PDB's which in CDB's.
	
	
	
					******ROOT CONTAINER******

	-- Every CDB has one root container.
	-- CDB$root 
	-- It contains metadata for oracle-supplied objects
		Redo Logs			Flashback 		Archived Logs
		Control F覺les		UNDO TEMP SYSAUX SYSTEM
	

		SEED PDB
	-- Seed PDB only for the cloning new pdb inside our CDB. it does serve to applications
	-- It's a template.
	-- Datbase files (system,temp and sytsaux) copies from seed PDB while creating new PDB
	-- When installation completed new pdb plugged to Container Database via Root Container
	
	
					******INSTALLATION******
					
		1- Create Database
		2- Advanced Mode
		3- Select Type of Database
		4- Select Create as Container Database
			This selection enables multitenant architecture otherwise it acts like 11g
				If you select 'Create an Empty Container Database' it only creates empty root container and seed container
